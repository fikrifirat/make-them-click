# The Idea
Place click-to-call buttons in e-mails with dynamic URLs that provide customers with direct access to the right person to help with their problem and carry all relevant data to your contact center with **literally one single click**

# How it works
Deploy a single page within your domain and place dynamic links in your e-mails that delivers all useful data to your contact center via URL parameters using the `Caller ID` or `SIP Context Headers`

Gets relevant data from the URL scheme

Modifies the `data-caler_id` or `data-context` fields to pass the data to your contact center.

# Use Cases
If your website/application has one of the following, it's highly likely that you already have some e-mailings in your business processes to call your users for action :

- Registration process with email confirmation
- Contact forms
- Support ticketing system/portal
- E-commerce / order tracking
- Book a reservation / appointment

Well, in most of these cases, you already provide your customers with an option to call you back. But when they do, they are most likely to call your general call menu, asked to press some buttons to connect to the right person, and when asked for some specific information (such as order number, support ticket number, customer id, appointment id, PNR code etc.) go back to the **original e-mail** you sent to to them and read that to the agent. Does this have to be this complicated? Obviously not. With a call button within that email which has a URL link that already transfers all relevant data to your contact center or agent, you can make this much faster and seamless for your customers.

### Calls from automated e-mails
The ultimate call to action for both your business and your customer is to call you. It's the most effective way for you to convert them to sign-up, purchase and finalise the deal. You can also dynamically pick the called number as well as the caller id from URL parameters and let the page call the customer's account manager, for example.

### Calls from support tickets
Provide support ticket id as a parameter to your URL and let your agent/support team see it even before answering the call

### Calls from order tracking
Place tracking id and customer data in your URL parameter 

### Calls from promotional e-mail campaigns
All such efforts are carried through to drive conversion. Increase your chances with a call button. Use company name and name of the caller, email campaign name and maybe caller's location from the URL and let your salesperson know what to say before answering the call.
